## Smart Health Card

### Idea: To create a smart health card 
 - When accidents happens
 - for knowing medical history of a patient with his Health Card
 - for knowing the past disease of a patient and name of doctor and hospital where his treatment has taken place.
 - Whenever an accident happens to someone, then in hospital he/she or his/her relative has to fill in all details, and then operations and treatments take place. But from this card, the patient  has not have to fill in his details, just provide the card to the receptionist or scan the card through a QR code and all the details will be provided to the hospital.
 - Alternatively, you can share your 12digit unique number written in the health card to share your details.
 - If patient wants to create his Medical Certificate at any time, he can create with this card.
 - All Reports related to the treatment of yours will also be listed in the health card.
 - If you are in some hospital where may be you feel your treatment is not going well and you are not satisfied with the hospital and if you want to shift to some other hospital then he/she can give card to other doctors for guidance about treatment.
 - If you want blood immediately and some reasons there is not blood in the Hospital then you can check our website with similar blood group patients and contact them for particular blood group.
 - TODO in future: Can create insurance or claims health insurance digitally.
